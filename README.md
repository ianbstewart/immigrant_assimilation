# Assimilation
A study of immigrant assimilation using both Facebook advertising data and a traditional survey.

## Install
Running the code requires installing packages with `conda`.
We need Python2.7 for `PySocialWatcher` until it gets upgraded to Python3+ (TBD).

```
conda create -n assimilation_py27 python=2.7 anaconda
conda install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running code

Before running code, the environment should be activated:

```
conda activate assimilation_py27
```

All code should be run from the base directory, e.g.:

```
python example_mine.py
```

To deactivate the environment after running code:

```
deactivate
```

## Progress to date

- Activated and tested access token (`src/data_processing/example_mine.py`).
- Mined audience counts for Hispanic people across languages (Spanish/Bilingual/English), age groups (young, middle-aged, old) and states, including the full Hispanic count and only Ex-pats from Mexico (`src/data_processing/mine_multiple_locations.py`).
- Compared the Ex-pat estimates with ground-truth census data (`src/data_processing/compare_facebook_survey_estimates.ipynb`).
- Compared the relative audience sizes of different age/language groups and found that younger Hispanic Facebook users (13-28) tended to be more bilingual and use less Spanish than older Hispanic users (28+). (`src/data_processing/compare_young_old_lang_use.ipynb`).
- Computed correlation in interest percentages and found that Hispanic Ex-pats from Mexico are closer to American interests than to Mexican interests (`src/data_processing/compare_facebook_survey_estimates.ipynb`): metrics include Pearson's correlation, paired t-test, and KL divergence.
- Extracted all interests related to music (`src/data_processing/extract_musical_interests.ipynb`)

## TODO

- Query for audience counts on music interests for (1) US Hispanic Mexican Expats and (2) US non-Expats. (7/6/18)
- Figure out MPI policy on funding for survey deployment.
- Assess Turk Prime as a platform for survey deployment (alternative to Facebook, in case of funding problems): how much representation of Hispanic people?
