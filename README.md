# Assimilation
A study of immigrant assimilation using both Facebook advertising data and a traditional survey.

## Install
Running the code requires installing packages with `conda`.
We need Python2.7 for `PySocialWatcher` until it gets upgraded to Python3+ (TBD).

```
conda create -n assimilation_py27 python=2.7 anaconda
conda install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running code

All code should be run from the base directory, e.g.:

```
python example_mine.py
```

To deactivate the environment after running code:

```
deactivate
```
